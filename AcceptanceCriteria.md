## User Story

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

## Acceptance Criteria

        -[] GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
                WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
                THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
        -[] WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
                THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
        -[] WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
                THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
        -[] WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
                THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
        -[] WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
                THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
